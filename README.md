Originally known as XENIA from the [VISOR](https://github.com/davidebolo1993/VISOR) project, Mimick is a 
simulator for linked-read FASTQ data. Mimick allows you to simulate an
arbitrary number of haplotypes, set overall coverage, molecule coverage,
and mix-match barcodes with linked-read chemistries.

## Supported Linked-Read Types:
- 10X
- Haplotagging
- stLFR
- TELLseq

> [!NOTE]
> Why name it "mimick"? Well, this software mimics linked-read data, I have an affinity for naming software after
> [fictional monsters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mimic_(Dungeons_%26_Dragons)) and "mimick" (with a "k") is the old-English
> spelling of the word, leaving `mimic` available for some other bioinformatician to use for a less farcical reason. Despite the
> lore of mimics being deadly traps, this software is anything but, I promise.
