# Mimick
Linked-read sequence simulator

![mimick_logo](resources/mimick_logo.svg)

Formerly known as XENIA from the [VISOR](https://github.com/davidebolo1993/VISOR) project, Mimick is a 
simulator for linked-read FASTQ data (10x, haplotagging, stlfr, tellseq). Mimick allows
you to simulate an arbitrary number of haplotypes, set overall coverage, molecule coverage,
and mix-match barcodes with linked-read chemistries.
